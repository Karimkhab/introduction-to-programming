# Assignment 1: Based Sum

Validate a list of numbers written in different bases (2, 8, 10, 16), convert them to decimal, adjust by index (+10 for odd, -10 for even), then output the final sum. If any input is invalid, print `Invalid inputs`.

## Input / Output

- Reads from `input.txt` and writes to `output.txt`.
- Input format:
  - N (1..40)
  - N space-separated numbers (max 6 digits, [0-9A-F])
  - N space-separated bases from {2, 8, 10, 16}

## Solution

- C source: `solution.c`
